# QA Automation Framework

End-to-end test automation framework covering API automation using Postman and Playwright, and UI automation using Playwright.

## Scope

- API automation using Playwright (code-based, scalable validations)
- UI automation using Playwright (core user flows)

## Key Features
- Authentication and CRUD flow validation
- Data-driven testing
- Reusable utilities and assertions
- Environment-based configuration
- CI-ready execution

## Tech Stack
- Postman
- Playwright
- Node.js
- GitHub Actions (CI)

## Project Structure
postman/ → Postman collections, environments, data
playwright/ → API and UI automation tests
.github/ → CI workflows


## Execution
- Postman: Runner / Postman CLI
- Playwright: npm scripts

---

This project is designed to demonstrate real-world QA automation practices with a clear separation of API and UI layers.
